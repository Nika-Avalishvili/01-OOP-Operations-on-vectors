# 01-OOP-Operations-on-vectors


Subject: Object-oriented programming, Polymorphism

1. In the beginning, the program asks the user in the menu what operation
   wants to do: add, subtract, multiply or divide;
2. After selecting the corresponding point on the previous move, vectors or numbers are entered interactively in the program;
3. The program displays the result of the performed operation on the screen;
4. The program has the feature of polymorphism:
   (e.g if the user enters both vectors then operations be performed on vectors, 
    and if a vector and a number are included - of a vector operation on a number);
5. The task was implemented in the OOP style.
